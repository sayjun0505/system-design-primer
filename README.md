### Learn how to design large scale systems

Learning how to design scalable systems will make you a better engineer.

System design is a broad topic.  There is a **vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web** on system design principles.

This repo is an **organized collection** of resources to help you learn how to build systems at scale.

Topics for learning system design:

* [System design topic summaries](#index-of-system-design-topics)
* [Real world architectures](#real-world-architectures)
* [Engineering blogs](#company-engineering-blogs)

#### Learn from the open source community

This is an **early draft** of a **continually updated, open source** project.
